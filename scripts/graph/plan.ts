/* Whether a node runs, and the sentence saying why. The reason is not decoration: a skipped step is
 * the one thing a reader cannot see happening, so a run that decides to skip has to be able to say
 * what it compared. The order of the tests is the order a reader would ask them in, cheapest and
 * most conclusive first, and the fingerprint answers last because it says only that something
 * moved. Declared outputs that are not on disk run the node whatever the fingerprint says, which is
 * what makes a deleted artifact and a fresh clone the same case. */
