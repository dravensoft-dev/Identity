/* The algebra over a set of declared nodes, and nothing about where they came from or what a spec
 * reaches: resolution is handed in, so this module holds no table and imports no script. Edges are
 * declared downstream, as `feeds`, and everything reading the other direction goes through
 * needsOf(). Ties in the order are broken by the position a node was collected at, so the sequence
 * a run prints is stable rather than whatever the queue happened to hold. */
