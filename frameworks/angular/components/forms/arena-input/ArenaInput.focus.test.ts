/* The one imperative handle in the layer, and the reason it is not a member: none of the nine
 * contract forms is imperative, and returning focus after each completed transaction is the

 * again every time, so the declarative alternative answers a different question.
 * IMPERATIVE_HANDLES in scripts/lib/arena/api-surface.ts is what lets check:api read a public
 * method here at all, and it names this one and no other. */
