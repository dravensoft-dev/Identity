/* The item renders an <a href> or a <button>, so no single interactive pattern always applies --
 * which is why it bound `none` with prose for as long as the schema could not say "this pattern
 * applies only when href is absent". It can, so it does. The `link` case binds `none` on purpose:
 * there is no link pattern, because a link's role, keyboard and focusability all come from the
 * platform, and `none` there means "verified presentational" only in the sense that this
 * component adds no affordance of its own beyond the anchor.
 * `states.disabled` is BEHAVIOURAL, so the verdict below is earned by rendering a disabled item
 * and acting on it rather than declared. The component gained `disabled` because casing it made
 * the gap visible: bound to `none` the requirement never applied, and a real <button> with no
 * disabled concept read as having no interactive pattern at all. */
