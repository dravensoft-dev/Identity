/* `minPointSpacing` is the member that lets a chart refuse to compress. The width it computes is
 * pure arithmetic and is asserted directly; what a suite cannot see is the scroll position, since
 * this render has no layout, so scrollWidth is zero and the anchor-to-the-right effect has
 * nothing to measure. That half is on the by-hand list in the prompt. */
