# Token/geometry boundary — the per-site classification

Produced by Task 3 of `2026-07-18-4-token-geometry-boundary.md`, from the output of
`bun scripts/check-dimension-literals.mjs --report` and
`bun scripts/check-dimension-literals.mjs --report=sites` (census taken at commit
`01d81fc`, 514 sites — this is the authority every editing task reads; the spec's
own counts (~290, "106 fontSize literals", etc.) are superseded and are not carried
forward here).

**Checkpoint 4 is answered.** Both clusters are resolved below and folded into the
`fs`/`dz` tables; this document carries the final assignment for all 514 sites.

## Four findings for Tasks 5, 6 and 9 to read here, not in their own (superseded) briefs

1. **`dz` needs 4 new steps plus a reset, not the 2 Task 6's brief anticipated.**
   That brief assumed `dz.text` (14) and `dz.text-sm` (12) would cover the
   chrome-text sites. The per-site pass found two more pixel tiers that clear
   Rule 3 on their own terms (2+ independent components, not a rounding of a
   neighboring step) — `dz.text-md` (13px, 19 sites) and `dz.text-xs` (11px, 23
   sites, including the 5 Checkpoint 4 Cluster A eyebrow sites at 11px) — plus a
   third, `dz.text-2xs` (10px, 7 sites, including the 2 Checkpoint 4 Cluster A
   eyebrow sites at 10px), the "column header / row micro-label" tier. A fifth
   addition is not a text-size step at all: a `dz` reset for `lineHeight: 1`
   (8 sites) — the spec names this explicitly ("this box is exactly its
   glyph... the reset belongs to `dz`"). Task 6 should read this document for
   its scope, not its own brief's step count.

2. **`icon` needs a 4th step at 34px — this is Checkpoint 3's answer, not a new
   question for Task 5 to re-derive.** `EmptyState` and `ErrorState` both render
   their icon prop at 34px, an illustration-scale role distinct from the 14/16/18
   inline-control cluster the spec indicated. Two independent components clear
   Rule 3. Task 5's Checkpoint 3 asks "three steps or four" — the per-site pass
   answers "four," and Task 5 should present this finding rather than
   re-measuring it.

3. **Two `sp`-family sites are hand-reclassified to `borders`.** A 1px-wide
   `<span>` (`BulkActionBar`'s vertical divider) and a 1px-tall `<div>`
   (`Menu`'s item divider) both use `width`/`height` to render a hairline rule —
   functionally identical to a `border`, not a spacing value. The mechanical `sp`
   snap rule (a value that is neither `4n` nor `4n+2` snaps to the nearest grid
   multiple) would have sent `1px` to `0`, deleting both dividers outright. Caught
   by a spot-check of the mechanical `sp` output, not the per-site JSX read (see
   *Coverage* below). Both are listed under **borders**, targeting `var(--bw)`;
   the sibling property on the same JSX line (the divider's length or margin)
   correctly stays `sp`.

4. **Task 9's own brief will be wrong about the `3px` border sites — this document
   corrects it.** Task 9's Step 3 says "the census reports one" 3px site and tells
   the implementer to inspect it. The per-site pass found **two**:
   `Calendar.jsx:169` (an event-color accent bar) and `Toast.jsx:11` (a
   tone-colored left bar) — the same accent-bar role in two independent
   components. Both are reasoned in the **borders** table above: adoption only
   means no new 3px step is minted, so both snap to the nearer of the two
   existing steps, `var(--bw-strong)`. Task 9 should read this document's
   `borders` table for the count and the reasoning rather than trusting its own
   brief's "one."

## How this was produced, and what "exhaustive" means here

Every one of the 514 sites was assigned individually — all 42 files under
`frameworks/react/components/**` and `frameworks/react/ui_kits/console/` were read
in full, and every `fontSize`, `letterSpacing`, `lineHeight`, `fontWeight` and
`zIndex` site (228 sites) was classified by reading the surrounding JSX to see what
text or glyph the property governs. This is a per-site pass, not a per-value one, for
exactly those five properties, because Rule 1 and Rule 2 require knowing what the text
*is*, not just what size it renders at.

The other 286 sites — `border*` (55), `borderRadius`-as-radius (1), and every
`padding`/`margin`/`gap`/`width`/`height`/`min*`/`max*`/`top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left`
site (229) — were classified **by value**, mechanically, per the brief's own
allowance ("where a value maps to one family unambiguously across every site... that
is sound and you should not pretend it was per-site"). The border and `sp` rules are
stated once below and applied uniformly; two sites where the mechanical rule would
have produced a visibly wrong result (a 1px divider snapping to 0 and disappearing)
were caught by eye during a spot-check of the mechanical output and corrected — see
finding 3 above. That spot-check covered every `sp`-family site whose value was NOT
a clean multiple of 4 (17 sites, all listed in the `sp` table's notes column) plus a
scan for `width`/`height` values of exactly 1, which is how the two dividers were
found. It did not re-derive every on-grid `calc()` by hand against the source file;
those are pure arithmetic on the census value and are not a place per-site judgement
can go wrong.

**Coverage statement:** exhaustive for all 514 sites in the sense that every one has a
row below. Per-site *reading* (not just per-value classification) was done for the 228
`fontSize`/`letterSpacing`/`lineHeight`/`fontWeight`/`zIndex` sites. The 286
`sp`/border/radius sites were classified by value with a targeted spot-check, not by
individually re-reading each file a second time for that property.

## A refinement of Rule 1: authored copy versus system-composed template

**This refines Rule 1, it does not contradict it — the read-aloud test still
decides; this states what the test is actually detecting.** Rule 1's own
wording ("a message with a subject and a verb") reads like a grammar test, but
a well-formed system-generated data row also has a subject and a verb and
would pass it — "ana@ approved the release" is a complete sentence. Applying
the read-aloud test to *that* text and stopping there gives the wrong answer.

The actual distinction the test is reaching for is **authored copy versus a
system-composed template**: text a person wrote once, versus text the system
assembles at render time from parts (actor + verb + object + timestamp, a
build number, a price). "We couldn't connect to the server. Retry." was
written by a person and shipped as a string — `fs`. "ana@ approved the
release" is `${actor} ${verb} ${object}` filled in from data — `dz`, the same
as a table cell or a log line, regardless of how sentence-shaped the
assembled result reads.

This is recorded here because plan 5 will need it across 34 manifests, and
"does it have a verb" would send a template-composed data row to `fs` every
time — the failure this refinement exists to head off.

## Methodology notes — where judgement was needed beyond a direct rule lookup

1. **Rule 1's own chrome examples resolved most of the "mono micro-label" question.**
   Rule 1 names *"a field label, a column header, a hint, a validation error, a
   badge, a legend"* as chrome, verbatim. Input/Select/Textarea's `label`, Table's
   column header, Radio's hint, Input's validation error, Badge's text, and a chart
   legend all match one of those examples directly, so they are `dz`, not `fs` —
   this is Rule 1 applied literally, not the older narrative in
   `specs/2026-07-18-token-geometry-boundary-design.md` ("fs.xs is the token for the
   mono uppercase micro-label... the 10px and 9px micro-labels... snap to 11"), which
   is a superseded illustrative count, not one of the three rules this task was told
   to apply. Where the two disagree, Rule 1's literal text governs, per the outer
   task's own framing ("the three rules... verbatim from the spec"). This resolves
   roughly 60 sites without ambiguity.

2. **The one shape Rule 1 did not name either way was the "eyebrow"** — the small
   uppercase kicker above a title (Card, Dialog, ConfirmDialog, Onboarding's
   `eyebrow` prop; ChartCard/StatCard's category label; LoginScreen's "Delivery
   console"). It is not a "column header" or "field label" in Rule 1's list, and it
   is not a sentence either. **Resolved at Checkpoint 4, Cluster A, below: `dz`,
   zero pixel move.** Applying Rule 1's own read-aloud test to the *text itself*
   ("REVENUE" means nothing read aloud) settles it as chrome, consistent with the
   rest of the microlabel tiers this pass already resolved as `dz`. The
   consequence recorded explicitly by the author: `fs.xs` is left with no
   consumer in `frameworks/react/` — accepted, not overlooked, because `fs` is
   the editorial scale, the React layer is mostly chrome, and `fs.xs` is read
   elsewhere in the repo. It is not proposed for deletion.

3. **`dz` gains more than the two steps Task 6's brief anticipated.** See finding
   1, above.

4. **`icon` gains a fourth step beyond the spec's indicated 14/16/18.** See
   finding 2, above.

5. **Two `sp`-family sites are reclassified to `borders` by hand.** See finding
   3, above.

6. **Two `lineHeight` sites at 1.55, and three `letterSpacing` sites at -.01em,
   are treated as accidental drift rather than new steps**, using the exact
   precedent the spec itself sets for `ChartCard`/`StatCard`'s `.2em` vs `.22em`
   ("invisible by eye and purely accidental"). `lineHeight: 1.55` (Alert's message
   body, Textarea's value) is 0.05 off `lh.body` (1.6) and serves the identical
   prose-wrapping role — corrected to `lh.body` rather than minted as its own step.
   `letterSpacing: -.01em` (3 sites: Dialog/ConfirmDialog/Onboarding titles) is 0.01
   off the existing `ls.tight` (-0.02) and serves the identical "tight display
   heading" role — corrected the same way.

7. **Three genuine ties are flagged, not silently broken.** Avatar's
   `letterSpacing: .02em` is exactly equidistant between `ls.normal` (0) and the
   new `ls.mono-nav` (.04); Menu's item-icon `fontSize: 17` is exactly
   equidistant between `icon.md` (16) and `icon.lg` (18) — both are low-stakes
   and are marked with a default in their table row rather than escalated.
   `ProjectScreen`'s overview metric `fontSize: 28` is exactly equidistant
   between `fs.h3` (24) and `fs.h2` (32); this one is a type snap-direction
   question and folds into Checkpoint 1 (Task 11), so it carries a
   `PENDING CHECKPOINT 1` marker rather than a default, the same as the sites in
   finding 8 below.

8. **Checkpoint 4, Cluster B (the "message" sites) resolved to `fs`, and four of
   its seven sites carry a `PENDING CHECKPOINT 1` marker rather than a concrete
   target.** `fs`'s scale is 11/13/15/17/19/24/32/44/64. The four sites at 14px
   (`EmptyState.message`, `ErrorState.message`, `Onboarding.step.body`, `Menu`'s
   item text, and `CommandPalette`'s "No results for…" — five, not four; see the
   table below) are **exactly equidistant** between `fs.sm` (13) and `fs.md` (15).
   That is a snap-direction tie in a semantic family, which is Checkpoint 1's
   question (Task 11), not this task's to settle — an earlier pass over this
   document incorrectly called it "nearest is `fs.sm`, a 1px move," which is
   wrong; 14 is equidistant from both, not nearer to either. The two sites at
   13px (`Alert.children`, `Toast.message`) already sit exactly on `fs.sm`, no
   tie, concrete target.

## The `sp` rule, stated once

Per the spec: `sp` is numeric, so every value is a derivation, never a new named
token, regardless of how many components share it.

- **Multiple of 4** (on-grid): `calc(var(--sp-1) * k)`, using `k = value / 4`.
- **`4n + 2`** (half-step): `calc(var(--sp-1) * (k + 0.5))`, matching the spec's own
  worked examples (`* 2.5` for 10px, `* 1.5` for 6px, etc.).
- **Anything else** (`4n ± 1`) — "does not derive cleanly," per the spec's own
  treatment of 9px and 5px — **snaps** to the nearest multiple of 4. This rule was
  applied to every off-pattern value found, not only the two the spec names; the 17
  sites this produced (mostly 1px/3px/5px/7px/9px micro-adjustments — icon nudges,
  step-indicator dots, a divider's own margin) are listed with a pixel-move note in
  the `sp` table.

## The borders rule, stated once

Counts below are re-derived from the `borders` table itself, not hand-edited —
a fix-pass-1 review caught this prose contradicting its own table once already.
**49 sites at `1px` → `var(--bw)`** (47 direct `border*` properties, plus the 2
sites reclassified from `sp` — the `BulkActionBar`/`Menu` dividers, see the
findings section above). **3 sites at `2px` → `var(--bw-strong)`.** **2 sites at
`3px`** (an event-color accent bar on `Calendar`, and `Toast`'s tone-colored left
bar — the same role in two components) have no existing 3px border step; adoption
only means no new step is minted, so both snap to the nearer of `{1,2}`, which is
also `var(--bw-strong)`. 49 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 56, the section's full total. One
`borderRadius` literal survives outside the circle
exemption (a 10×10 legend swatch at `DoughnutChart`, `borderRadius: 2`) and is
listed separately under **radius**, snapping to `var(--r-xs)` (4px) — the nearest
existing radius step, since `r` has none smaller.

## fs — editorial type (Rule 1: prose)

Includes the 7 Checkpoint 4 Cluster B sites resolved to `fs` (marked in their
Note column): 5 of them (all at 14px) carry a `PENDING CHECKPOINT 1` target,
tied between `fs.sm`/`fs.md`; the other 2 (at 13px) land concretely on `fs.sm`.
8 sites in this table total carry a `PENDING CHECKPOINT 1` marker — those 5,
plus the 3 from the original pass (`Card.jsx:12`, `Onboarding.jsx:28`,
`ProjectScreen.jsx:80`). That direction belongs to Task 11.

## dz — control density (Rule 1: chrome)

Includes the 7 Checkpoint 4 Cluster A sites resolved to `dz` (marked in their
Note column). Existing step: `dz.text` (14px). New steps this census supports
under Rule 3: `dz.text-md` (13px), `dz.text-xs` (11px), `dz.text-2xs` (10px), and
a `lineHeight: 1` reset. `dz.text-sm` (12px) is Task 6's own already-planned step.
See finding 1, above. `Select.jsx:20`'s `▾` caret, originally placed here, moved
to `icon` in fix pass 1 (author's ruling — see the `icon` table below).

## icon (Rule 2)

Steps: `icon.sm` (14), `icon.md` (16), `icon.lg` (18), and `icon.xl` (34, new — see
finding 2, above). `Select.jsx:20`'s `▾` caret joined this family in fix pass 1:
Rule 2 ("a glyph rendered as a font is `icon`, not type") carves out no
exception for which font ships the glyph, and the same affordance is already
`icon` at `Calendar.jsx:89` and `Pagination.jsx:21` — splitting one affordance
across two families by implementation accident is exactly the drift the rules
exist to stop.

| File:line | Property | Now | Target | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frameworks/react/components/display/Calendar.jsx:88` | `fontSize` | `16` | icon.md (16) | prev/next chevron |

The same affordance is already icon at Calendar.jsx:89 and Pagination.jsx:21; splitting one affordance across two families by implementation accident is the drift the rules exist to stop. Singleton at 12px among icon sizes, snaps to nearest (icon.sm=14, diff 2, vs the next icon step up being far larger) |

| `frameworks/react/components/navigation/Pagination.jsx:20` | `fontSize` | `16` | icon.md (16) | pagination chevron |

Family assignment only. The order and the exact token names are Checkpoint 2,
reserved for Task 4 — not answered here.

## ls — tracking

Existing: `ls.tight` (-.02), `ls.normal` (0), `ls.label` (.22), `ls.wide` (.34, kept,
no React consumer in this census — used by the Overview, per the author's standing
ruling). New steps this census supports under Rule 3: `ls.field-label` (.14),
`ls.column-header` (.12), `ls.badge` (.1), `ls.uppercase-status` (.06),
`ls.mono-nav` (.04). This table was unaffected by Checkpoint 4 — the eyebrow
sites' `letterSpacing` was already `ls.label` regardless of whether the
`fontSize` landed in `fs` or `dz`; only the sibling `fontSize` rows moved.

| File:line | Property | Now | Target | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frameworks/react/components/charts/ChartCard.jsx:17` | `letterSpacing` | `'.2em'` | ls.label (.22) | drift-correct from .2em (same as ChartCard/StatCard case the spec names) |

## lh — line height

Existing: `lh.tight` (.98), `lh.snug` (1.15), `lh.body` (1.6). No new steps —
every site here either matches an existing step, snaps to the nearest one, or is a
drift-correction to `lh.body` (see methodology note 6). The `lineHeight: 1` sites are
not in this table — they are a `dz` reset, listed under **dz**. This table was
unaffected by Checkpoint 4 — the message sites' `lineHeight` is prose-shaped either
way, independent of whether their `fontSize` landed in `fs` or `dz`.

| File:line | Property | Now | Target | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frameworks/react/components/display/StatCard.jsx:27` | `lineHeight` | `1.1` | lh.snug (1.15) — snap | nearest of tight/snug/body to 1.1 |
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/Alert.jsx:21` | `lineHeight` | `1.55` | lh.body (1.6) — drift-correct from 1.55 | independent of the fs/dz outcome above; the wrap is prose-shaped either way |

## Checkpoint 4 — resolved

Two clusters, not 14 loose questions. Both are folded into the `fs`/`dz` tables
above; this section is the record of the ruling and its reasoning.

### Cluster A — the "eyebrow" / kicker format (7 sites) → `dz`, zero pixels move

The small uppercase mono label above a title or big value: `Card`, `Dialog`,
`ConfirmDialog`, `Onboarding`'s `eyebrow` prop; `ChartCard`/`StatCard`'s category
label; `LoginScreen`'s "Delivery console".

| File:line | Property | Text it renders | Now | Resolved to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frameworks/react/components/display/Card.jsx:11` | `fontSize`/`letterSpacing` | `eyebrow` prop, e.g. a category label above the card title | 11px, .22em | `dz.text-xs` (11), `ls.label` (.22) |
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/Dialog.jsx:34` | `fontSize`/`letterSpacing` | `eyebrow` prop | 11px, .22em | `dz.text-xs` (11), `ls.label` (.22) |
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/ConfirmDialog.jsx:17` | `fontSize`/`letterSpacing` | `eyebrow` prop, defaults to "Confirm" | 11px, .22em | `dz.text-xs` (11), `ls.label` (.22) |
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/Onboarding.jsx:27` | `fontSize`/`letterSpacing` | `step.eyebrow` | 11px, .22em | `dz.text-xs` (11), `ls.label` (.22) |
| `frameworks/react/components/charts/ChartCard.jsx:17` | `fontSize`/`letterSpacing` | `title` prop — an uppercase muted microlabel, explicitly NOT a heading per the component's own doc comment | 10px, .2em (drift off .22) | `dz.text-2xs` (10), `ls.label` (.22, drift-correct) |
| `frameworks/react/components/display/StatCard.jsx:23` | `fontSize`/`letterSpacing` | `label` prop, e.g. "REVENUE" | 10px, .2em (drift off .22) | `dz.text-2xs` (10), `ls.label` (.22, drift-correct) |
| `frameworks/react/ui_kits/console/LoginScreen.jsx:16` | `fontSize`/`letterSpacing` | literal text "Delivery console" | 11px, .22em | `dz.text-xs` (11), `ls.label` (.22) |

**Author's answer:** `dz`. Zero pixels move.

**Reason:** Rule 1's own test applied to the *text* settles it. "REVENUE" read
aloud with no interface around it means nothing, so it is chrome. This groups the
eyebrow with the other microlabel tiers the pass already resolved as `dz` (field
label, column header, badge), and it moves no pixels — both 10 and 11 get a `dz`
step at their own value.

**Consequence, recorded explicitly:** `fs.xs` is left with no consumer in
`frameworks/react/`. That is accepted, not overlooked. `fs` is the editorial
scale and the React layer is mostly chrome; a scale step with no React consumer
is not dead API, because `fs.xs` is read elsewhere in the repo. **Do not propose
deleting it.**

### Cluster B — a message inside a chrome container (7 sites) → `fs`, this one moves pixels

The spec names four of these in advance; the exhaustive pass found three more with
the identical shape (a full sentence or status string, rendered inside a component
whose other text is unambiguously chrome).

| File:line | Property | Text it renders | Now | Resolved to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/EmptyState.jsx:9` | `fontSize` | `message` prop — e.g. "There's nothing here yet." | 14px, lh 1.6 | `fs` — PENDING CHECKPOINT 1 (fs.sm=13 or fs.md=15, exactly tied) |
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/ErrorState.jsx:10` | `fontSize` | `message` prop — e.g. "We couldn't reach the server. Try again." | 14px, lh 1.6 | `fs` — PENDING CHECKPOINT 1 (fs.sm=13 or fs.md=15, exactly tied) |
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/Onboarding.jsx:29` | `fontSize` | `step.body` — the coachmark's explanatory paragraph | 14px, lh 1.6 | `fs` — PENDING CHECKPOINT 1 (fs.sm=13 or fs.md=15, exactly tied) |
| `frameworks/react/components/navigation/Menu.jsx:68` | `fontSize` | `item.label` — the menu item's own text (e.g. "Rename", but the slot is generic and can hold longer copy) | 14px | `fs` — PENDING CHECKPOINT 1 (fs.sm=13 or fs.md=15, exactly tied) |
| `frameworks/react/components/navigation/CommandPalette.jsx:30` | `fontSize` | literal text `No results for "{q}".` | 14px | `fs` — PENDING CHECKPOINT 1 (fs.sm=13 or fs.md=15, exactly tied) |
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/Alert.jsx:21` | `fontSize` | `children` — the alert's body copy | 13px, lh 1.55→1.6 | `fs.sm` (13) — exact match |
| `frameworks/react/components/feedback/Toast.jsx:14` | `fontSize` | `message` prop | 13px | `fs.sm` (13) — exact match |

**Author's answer:** `fs`. This one moves pixels.

**Reason:** Rule 1's test asks about the text, not the container, and these pass
it — "We couldn't connect to the server. Retry." is literally the spec's own
worked example of prose. Applying the test consistently in both clusters is what
stops Rule 1 eroding into "look at the container," which plan 5 would then have
to apply 34 times.

**Correction made against the first pass over this document:** `fs`'s scale is
11/13/15/17/19/24/32/44/64. 14px is **exactly equidistant** between `fs.sm` (13)
and `fs.md` (15) — a tie, and a tie in a semantic family is a snap-direction
question, which is **Checkpoint 1, in Task 11**, not something this task settles.
The five sites at 14px (one more than the spec's four named sites — the
exhaustive pass's `CommandPalette` addition is also 14px) each carry a
`PENDING CHECKPOINT 1` marker, the same form already used for `Card.jsx:12`,
`Onboarding.jsx:28` and `ProjectScreen.jsx:80`. Only the two sites at 13px
(`Alert`, `Toast`) land unambiguously on `fs.sm` and carry a concrete target now.

## Family totals

| Family | Sites | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `fs` | 23 | includes the 7 resolved from Checkpoint 4 Cluster B; 8 total sites carry a `PENDING CHECKPOINT 1` marker (3 from the original pass + 5 from Cluster B) |
| `dz` | 100 | includes the 7 resolved from Checkpoint 4 Cluster A, and the 8 `lineHeight: 1` resets; `Select.jsx:20`'s caret moved to `icon` in fix pass 1 |
| `icon` | 17 | includes 1 tie (Menu, flagged); gained `Select.jsx:20`'s `▾` caret in fix pass 1 (author's ruling: Rule 2 applies regardless of which font ships the glyph) |
| `z` | 8 | order pending Checkpoint 2 |
| `ls` | 34 | includes 1 tie (Avatar, flagged) — unaffected by Checkpoint 4 |
| `lh` | 13 | unaffected by Checkpoint 4 |
| `fw` | 33 | |
| borders | 56 | 49 sites at 1px (47 direct + 2 reclassified from `sp`) + 3 at 2px + 2 snapped from 3px |
| radius | 1 | |
| `sp` | 229 | includes 17 pixel-moving snaps, listed in-table |
| **Total** | **514** | matches the census exactly |

23 + 100 + 17 + 8 + 34 + 13 + 33 + 56 + 1 + 229 = **514**. No site reached no
family — every one of the 514 has a row in exactly one table above. Checkpoint 4
is fully resolved; nothing is pending assignment. 8 `fs`-family sites carry a
`PENDING CHECKPOINT 1` marker (a snap-*direction* question for Task 11), which is
a different, narrower kind of "pending" than an unassigned family.
